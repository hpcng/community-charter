# The Next Generation of High-Performance Computing Community Charter -- Community Structure

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to introduce you to, and better define, the Next Generation of High-Performance Computing (HPCng) community, including its community and development goals. This document is a work in progress and feedback, comments, and suggestions are encouraged.

## Organizational and Governance Structure
The goal of HPCng is to become a tax exempt non-profit, both in the US as well as abroad (e.g., Switzerland). This is a long and arduous process here in the US but this is the shared goal of the HPCng Board of Directors.

## Board of Directors
HPCng is a community, so it is important for it to be led by a community-based group instead of an individual.  To that end, an HPCng Board of Directors (HBOD) has been formed to share the leadership and decision making responsibilities.

At the time of this writing, the confirmed board members are as follows:

- Greg Kurtzer: Founder and CEO of CtrlIQ, Chairman of the Board
- Brock Taylor: Director of HPC Solutions at AMD, Inc., Executive Director
- Andrew Younge, PhD: Computer Scientist, Sandia National Laboratories, DOE
- Brent Gorda: Senior Director of HPC at ARM, Inc.
- Glen Otero, PhD: Vice President of Scientific Computing, TGen

The roles of the HBOD are as follows (but not limited to therein, as the structure is still developing):
- Establish vision, mission, and values of HPCng
- Approve, agree, and amend the necessary documents (including this charter)
- Be an escalation point of authority for decision making process when necessary
- Define and maintain the board membership
- Appoint the leadership of HPCng whom will execute the vision, mission, and values of the organization
- Ensure proper communication and transparency in being an open community and organization
- Handle the establishment of the financial and legal structure of HPCng

In summation, the HBOD is responsible for the high level structure, organization, and vision, not the day-to-day management of the organization.

## Management Structure
As the HBOD is predominantly responsible for high level matters of HPCng, day-to-day responsibility will be undertaken by the management team.

The roles and responsibilities of this management team are initially defined as the Executive Director and team members including project leads and advisors. The structure of the management team is expected to grow organically with membership and activity to include additional titled positions to help maintain the community. For example, in the future, there may be official roles on the management team that include:

- Executive Director
- Director of Operations
- - Systems infrastructure management
- Director of communications/PR
- Secretary/Admin
- Community Manager

The roles and responsibilities of the management team are currently being discussed and evolving based on the speed of projects and participation of volunteers joining the community.

## Discussions and collaboration
We will hold recurring meetings to facilitate collaboration on the above topics, discuss additional topics of interest, organize teams, presentations, and votes. Attendance to these meetings will be open to anybody who wishes to join, and everyone is encouraged to be part of these.

Agendas will be posted and everybody can influence the discussions.
